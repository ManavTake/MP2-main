        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
        In today's digital age, big companies use personal data from phones, websites visited, and even texts to deliver targeted advertisements. 
        While this practice enhances advertising effectiveness, it raises significant data breach and privacy concerns. Our project aims to address 
        this issue by utilizing <b>Federated Learning</b>â€”a revolutionary machine learning technique designed to train algorithms across decentralized devices while keeping all the training data local.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h4>Benefits of our model :</h4>
        <ol className='List'>
          <li><b>Enhanced Privacy Protection:</b> Training data remains on local devices, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches and misuse.</li>
          <li><b>Improved Consumer Trust:</b> By respecting user privacy, our solution enhances consumer trust in digital advertising practices.</li>
          <li><b>Effective Advertising:</b> Combining user data from advertisers and app-related activities improves targeting accuracy, leading to better ad performance.</li>
          <li><b>Increased Click-Through Rates (CTR):</b> Significant improvements in CTR indicate more relevant ads being shown to users.</li>
          <li><b>Reduced Cost per Action (CPA):</b> Enhanced targeting accuracy leads to more efficient ad spend, reducing the overall CPA.</li>
          <li><b>Reduced Centralized Storage Risks:</b> By avoiding centralized data storage, we mitigate risks associated with data breaches and misuse</li>
        </ol>
